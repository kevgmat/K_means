# K_means
 K-means task: After you’re done with some theory of k-means algorithm and you have visualised how k-means works in 2D, we would like you to implement the same algorithm on this 5D dataset attached with the email. Note: This data has both outliers and null values (read up on what they are). We do not expect you to do anything about the outliers, but you must fill the null values using any of the popular ways available. Similar to how we have x,y on Cartesian Plane, consider this dataset to have coordinates like x1,x2,x3,x4,x5. You may use libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, but not like tensorflow, or sklearn (don’t worry about these names, just start building everything in Python and you will understand everything) which already have entire algorithm inbuilt. We do NOT care about the accuracy.
